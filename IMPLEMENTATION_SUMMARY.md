# SSE Implementation - Muhammad Asad

## What I Built
A server-sent events system for real-time notifications. The app can now push updates from server to browser without polling.

## Main Files
- `/src/features/sse/` - Core SSE service & hooks
- `/api/sse` - Connection endpoint
- `/api/sse-broadcast` - Broadcasting endpoint
- `/sse-demo` - Demo page

## How It Works
1. Browser connects to SSE endpoint
2. Server keeps connection open
3. Server can push events anytime
4. Auto-reconnects if connection drops
5. Heartbeat every 30s to keep alive

## Quick Test
- Open `/sse-demo` in 2 tabs
- Send message from one
- See it appear in both instantly

That's it. Simple real-time messaging without websockets.
